# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

I created a vault and this vault contains the following functions in the smart contract:
a. Create Grant
b. Revoke Grant
c. Get the balance of the beneficiaries
d. Get the balance of the contract.

Having done that, included in this document is a script to interact with the smart contract.
